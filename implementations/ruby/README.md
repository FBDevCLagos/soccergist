# Soccergist - Ruby

## Requirements
To run the app you'll need have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed

## Running the app
* Clone the repo
* cd into the ruby implementation folder
* Run `bundle install` to install app dependencies
* Rename _.env.example_ to _.env_ and update content with valid entries for your setup
* Run `rackup`
* App should be available on port 9292

To enable hot reloading (so that you don't have to restart the app for every change you made), install `shotgun` (`gem install shotgun`) and then use it to run the app.

`shotgun`
