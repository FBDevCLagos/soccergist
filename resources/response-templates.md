# What are response templates
_- Oscar_

The messenger platform provides a slew of templates for creating various user experiences on the messenger platform. You can think of these as a kind of HTML - CSS mashup. It's akin to when you get a template online and replace the content placeholders with your own stuff and then use it for your site. Now extrapolate that to having different types/design of templates for different pages on your website but in the case of the bot, the different templates are for different type of responses and desired user interaction.

These templates include 
* Button template
* Media template
* List template
* Generic template
* Open Graph template
* Receipt template
* Airline template

They offer a way for you to offer a richer in-conversation experience than standard text messages by integrating buttons, images, lists etc
