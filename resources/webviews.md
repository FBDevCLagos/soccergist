# What are Webviews?
_- Oscar_

A Webview allows you to load web pages inside Messenger similar to iframes on web apps. Remember iframes? Yea, just how you load another webpage within a page using an iframe, same way, with webview, you can load a webpage within messenger.

Why? Well, webview has been the source of many debates largely because it's easily prone to abuse but the popular verdict is to use it if the experience/feature you want to offer is not possible with other messenger platform offerings.
That being said, webviews are pretty powerful and allow you bring some really cool experiences to the Messenger platform. We review an impressive use case for it in one of our Bot review series. The ability to load standard webpages means you can leverage the extensive power of your normal web technologies, like javascript. And you can combine this with the FB javascript SDK to communicate between Messenger and the Webview in real-time.

Aside information on how to hookup webviews to buttons and menu items, the webview documentation provides good insights into the various possibilities alongside best practices and sample use cases. Give it a quick read: https://developers.facebook.com/â€¦/messenger-platform/webview
