# HOW TO CREATE A FACEBOOK PAGE
_- Oscar_

One of the three important setups needed for Messenger bot is a Facebook page. _The other two are a [Facebook app](how-to-create-a-facebook-app.md) and your hosted backend_

The Facebook page serves as the anchor for your bot on Facebook. One of the inspirations behind the messenger bot is enabling businesses to improve customer interactions on their brand pages on Facebook by automating (and customizing) customer services and experience. So based on your configuration, your Facebook page is one place users will come to interact with your bot.

The official help guide to create a page can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/104002523024878). Re-echoing the process, the steps to create a page is as follows:
* Go to [https://www.facebook.com/pages/create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).

    There, you would be presented with various page types to choose from.

 * Click your desired page type. (Pick one that's closely representative of the general intent of your business/bot).
