# Quick Reply
_- Oscar_

Quick replies come in handy to provide users with, well, a quick way to reply :). 
They are particularly ideal when a user's response is expected to be one of a range of known options. Much like radio options in web forms. For example, if you prompted the user to provide their favourite day of the week, the expected response should ideally be any of the seven days, Sunday through Saturday. For such scenario, it makes good sense to provide them with these seven options to quickly select from.

Aside, saving users the effort of having to type in their response (and instead select from provided options), it helps check variations that come with handling such inputs. As we'll discuss later, handling user input can quickly get ugly. For our simple favourite day of the week example, a user might enter 'Monday', another 'Mon', yet another, 'M'. These plus the plethora of possible misspellings starts painting a picture of the challenge free-form input could be.

More so quick replies have some cool provisions for fetching common user info. Special quick reply buttons: location, email and phone number will have these options prepopulated with the user's info from FB and all they have to do is tap to confirm. (For location it opens up a map).
